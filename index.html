        <p>Hi, I’m Dana Katisya, a passionate and driven software developer based in Kenya. 
            I specialize in building dynamic web applications using modern technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Vue.js, and Node.js. 
            My journey into tech has been fueled by curiosity, resilience, and a love for solving real-world problems through code. <br></br>

            With hands-on experience in JavaScript and frontend frameworks like React.js, 
            I excel at creating user-centric, responsive, and visually appealing applications. 
            My portfolio includes innovative projects like an interactive lexicon website and affiliate marketing platforms such as Doggy Door, 
            where I merge technical expertise with creative design. <br></br> 
            
            Beyond coding, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to develop impactful, 
            cutting-edge solutions while continuously exploring new areas in technology, 
            particularly in AI and mobile development.<br> </br> 
            
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy freelancing, reading, working on entrepreneurial ventures, 
            and exploring the intersection of technology and design. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and 
            collaborate on impactful projects that make a difference in the tech space.
